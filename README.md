A python program that generates visual poems from two different text sources. It randomized the texts by lines, place them side by side, and let them collide into each other to create a language collision visual.

More about the process of this project can be found [here](https://www.shelleyhu.net/neutralizer).

Below are a few generated examples from the same two texts:

["Kim’s death impacts North Korea’s image in China"](http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0222/c90000-9181169.html) - from Poeple.cn

["China Loses a Friend, and Leverage, With North Korean Murder"](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-16/china-loses-a-friend-and-leverage-with-north-korean-murder) - from Bloomberg
